# IndonesiaMaps
The map templates provided here are for general use to create choropleth, hex grid, and tile grid maps of the 38 provinces in Indonesia. 

There are two approaches to building the tile grid map in Excel:
1.	Spreadsheet version. One version simply uses a grid layout and some VLOOKUP formulas to pull the data into the grid, and then using the conditional formatting menu to add the colors. 
2.	Scatterplot version. This version uses square-shaped markers in a scatterplot, sized enough to touch by not overlap. 

The hex grid map in Excel using 0.5"x0.5" hexagons arrayed in an Excel scatterplot. Adjusting the size of the hexagons may require adjusting the layout of the points.
